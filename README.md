# BrainFD
The available implement the calculations of Fractal dimension, Lacunarity, rmse, y intercept. The files (scripts, datasets plots) for the final analysis are included in the svm_data rar.

boxplots.py file          as used to create the boxplots that are shown in the paper
convert_mgz_to_npz.sh     converts mgz to nii
create_npz.py             it converts nii files to npz and reduces the size of volume

fd3D_brain_structure.py   performs the calculations to estimate Df, PÎ›, y intercept, rmse , volume of a given brain region

labels41_vxm.csv          is the file with the lables of vxm (1st column) and freesurfer (2nd column)
